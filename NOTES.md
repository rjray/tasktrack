# Notes

This file explains the application in more detail, as well as gives
instructions on setting it up and running it.

## Project Capstone

As the capstone project for the Coursera specialization, _Responsive Website
Development and Design_, this project is developed using the
[Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) platform, with
[React.js](https://reactjs.org/) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for
the UI (by way of the [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)
layer).

## Setting Up/Running

After unzipping the file and changing to the project folder, run the
following commands:

```bash
$ meteor npm install
$ meteor
```

This should install all the dependent modules, set up and configure the
Meteor platform, and start the application on port 3000.
